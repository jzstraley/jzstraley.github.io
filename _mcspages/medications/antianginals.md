- Nitrates
  - General
    - Used to relieve chest pain in patients with stable angina pectoris and acute coronary syndrome
    - Primarily vasodilators and dilate, veins, arterioles, and coronary arteries by relaxing vascular smooth muscle cells, venodilators
    - Angina improved due to systemic vasodilation (decreased preload)
      - Their primary anti-ischemic effects are due to systemic vasodilation and decrease in cardiac preload rather than coronary vasodilation
      - Systemic venodilation lowers preload and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume
      - This causes reduced LV wall stress reducing myocardial oxygen demand, and relieving anginal symptoms
      - Arterial and arteriolar vasodilation can decrease systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure, but to a lesser degree
    - They do act as coronary vasodilators, but benefit is uncertain
    - No direct effect on cardiac chronotropy or inotropy (contractility) and left ventricular ejection fraction
  - Isosorbide Dinitrate
  - Isosorbide Mononitrate
  - Sodium Nitroprusside
    - Parenteral vasodilator with quick onset and offset of action and is commonly used for rapid BP control in patients with hypertensive emergency
      - Its metabolism releases NO and Cyanide
      - Induces arteriolar and venous vasodilation
      - May cause reflex tachycardia and enhance ventricular contraction increasing aortic wall stress (give BB first)
    - SE: Irreversible Cyanide toxicity (Thiocyanate, most common in renal insufficiency), disorientation, Headache, tinnitus, Tachyphylaxis
  - SE: Reflex Tachycardia
    - Concomitant use of beta blockers to prevent
  - Nitroglycerin
    - IV: Use only for patients with ACS or Acute pulmonary edema
    - Avoid in patients with RV infarction and those on PDE-5 inhibitors
