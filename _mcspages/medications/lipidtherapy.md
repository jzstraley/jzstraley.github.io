- Elevated LDL-C
  - Diet: Trans/Saturated Fats, Weight gain, Anorexia, Alcohol
  - Drug: Diuretics, Cyclosporines, Glucocorticoids, Amiodarone
  - Diseases: Biliary Obstruction, Nephrotic Syndrome
  - Other: Hypothyroidism, Obesity, Pregnancy

- Dietary fat has a greater impact on serum LDL-C than does dietary cholesterol intake
  - Fats should be limited to \<30% of total caloric intake
  - Saturated fats should be limited to \<10% of calories (7% if LDL-C above goal)
- Higher-Risk
  - The following factors that may be considered for the identification of higher-risk patients with clinical CV disease:
    - Age ≥65 years, prior MI or non-hemorrhagic stroke, current daily cigarette smoking, symptomatic PVD with prior MI or stroke, history of non-MI related coronary revascularization, residual coronary artery disease with ≥40% stenosis in ≥2 large vessels, HDL \<40 mg/dL for men and \<50 mg/dL for women, hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L, or metabolic syndrome
- Liver
  - Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, LDL)

    - Trials
      - IMPROVE-IT (2015)
        - Adding ezetimibe to statin further reduces CV events in the population, suggesting the maximal LDL reduction is the key mech
    - SE: Hepatotoxicity
      - If AST/ALT ≥ 3x ULN, reduce or switch

    - Trials
      - FOURIER (2017)
        - Among patients with clinical atherosclerotic disease and LDL ≥ 70 despite high or moderate intensity statin therapy (70% high intensity), Evolocumab resulted in an absolute 1.5% reduction in MACE at 26m. Mainly from reduction in nonfatal MI, stroke, and revascularization.
          - No mortality benefits
          - Absolute reduction in CVE was greater with more advanced CKD
      - ODESSEY OUTCOMES (2021)
        - In recent ACS and LDL ~70 on optimized statin therapy, PCSK9 inhibitors provide clinical benefit only when lp(a) is at least mildly elevated.
