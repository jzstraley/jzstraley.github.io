### Hypercalcemia
-	General
    -	Defined as total serum >10.2-10.3 mg/dl if normal albumin
        -	Or ionized serum calcium >5.2 mg/dl 
            -	Only one that is active metabolically
                    -	No symptoms usually until >12 mg/dl
-	1) Calculate Corrected Ca2+ if Albumin is low
    -	CCa2+ = (0.8 x (normal albumin-pt albumin)) + serum Ca2+
-	2) Repeat Serum Calcium + Measure Serum PTH
    -	Distinguishes PTH dependent from non-PTH dependent
        -	If Low/Normal: Get PTHrP
            -	If Normal, Get Vit D (25-OH Vit D)
                -	Granulomatous Disease, Exogenous Vitamin D, Acromegaly
        -	High: Primary/Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism/FHH
            -	Urinary Ca2+
-	Etiology
    -	Increased calcium ECF levels and a decrease in renal clearance of calcium
    -	90% from Primary Hyperparathyroidism or Malignancy
-	Common Causes:
    -	Parathyroid mediated (outpatients)
        -	W/U: 24hr Urinary Calcium
        -	A) Primary Hyperparathyroidism
            -	MCC of hypercalcemia
            -	Normal or elevated urinary calcium
                -	(Ca2+ typically within 1mg/dl of normal)
                -	30% hypercalciuria
                -	Low or low-normal serum phos
            -	Parathyroid adenoma (~85%)
            -	Hyperplasia (~15%)
            -	Carcinoma (~1%)
                -	Ca >14 typically
                -	Resection

            -	Elevated PTH
            -	Diagnosis: PTH
                -	If (+), DEXA Scan to characterize (nondominant distal 1/3rd of the radius)
            -	Treatment
                -	Surgery likely if:
                    -	Ca2+ >1 above ULN
                    -	Cr <60 or kidney stones

        -	C) Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (FHH)
            -	Mutation in calcium sensing receptor
