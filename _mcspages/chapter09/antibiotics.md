- General
  - Above the diaphragm (Aspiration pneumonia, lung abscesses, oral infections)
    - 1) Clindamycin
  - Below the Diaphragm (Intra-abdominal anaerobic infections)
    - 1) Metronidazole
- Monitoring
  - Aminoglycosides/Vancomycin
    - If IV ≥3 days or ≥2 days in a renal patient
  - Penicillin causing rash
    - Not a contraindication for cephalosporins
      - Breathing issues, edema are CIs
- Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid (Augmentin)
- Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn)
- Ceftriaxone
  - SE: Cholestasis
- Cefazolin
  - Prophylaxis for skin flora
- Cefepime
  - Coverage
    - Pseudomonas, MSSA, Strep Pneumo, H. Influenzae
  - Misses
    - Enterococcus
  - SE: Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, Seizure, Delirium, C. Difficile, Transaminitis, Hemolytic anemia, interstitial nephritis
- Ceftaroline
  - 5th gen cephalosporin, only one that covers MRSA
- Clindamycin
  - MOA: Inhibits protein synthesis
  - Effective against Bacteroides and c. perfringens
- Chloramphenicol
  - 50S static
  - Associated w/ blood dyscrasias
- Daptomycin (Cubicin)
  - Can be considered for MRSA infections when the isolate's vancomycin MIC is ≥2 nanograms/mL or when the vancomycin MIC is close to 2 nanograms/mL and the clinical response is poor
    - Test susceptibility first
  - Coverage
    - MRSA, VRE
  - SE: LFT elevations, Acute eosinophilic pneumonia, peripheral neuropathy, Falsely elevated INR, Rhabdomyolysis (CK (DC if ≥2000 or ≥1000 w/myopathy), stop statins)
- Meropenem (Merrem)
  - Coverage
    - Pseudomonas
- Metronidazole
  - MOA: Contains a nitro group that acts as an electron sink, capturing electrons and creating free radicals which disrupts DNA synthesis via a cytotoxic intermediate (Bactericidal)
  - Effective against Bacteroides, prevotella, fusobacterium, clostridium
  - SE:
    - Disulfiram-like reaction (severe flushing, tachycardia, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, hypotension) with alcohol
    - Metallic taste
    - Headache
- Piperacillin-Tazobactam (Zosyn)
  - Coverage
    - Pseudomonas, Proteus
  - Misses
    - C. Difficile
  - SE: Rash, Drug fever, Prolonged PT, Leukopenia, Thrombocytopenia
- Telavancin
  - Lipoglycopeptide derivative of vancomycin and can be given once daily
  - More side effects than Vancomycin, worse kidney injury
- Tuberculosis Medications
  - Rifampin
    - Benign, red color to body secretions
  - Isoniazid
    - Peripheral Neuropathy
    - Use pyridoxine to prevent
  - Pyrazinamide
    - Benign, Hyperuricemia (Gout)
  - Ethambutol
    - Optic neuritis/color vision changes
    - Decrease dose in renal failure
- TMP/SMX
  - CI: Warfarin/Methotrexate use, allergy, elderly with renal insufficiency
- Vancomycin
  - Red Man Syndrome
    - MC adverse event, hypersensitivity not reaction
    - Usually 5-10 minutes after starting infusion
    - Diffuse erythema, pruritus, and tenderness over the skin above the waist
    - +/- hypotension, dyspnea if severe
    - Treatment
      - Stop infusion, give antihistamines, restart infusion at slower rate
  - Dosing Guidelines

      - Area under the curve, Mean inhibitory concentration
      - Goal for AUC/MIC to be achieved in 24-48 hours
    - Empiric Therapy
      - AUC/MIC calculation for empiric therapy assumes MIC to be 1 nanogram/ml or less
    - MRSA Native Tricuspid Valve Endocarditis
      - AUC/MIC target of 400-600 mg\*hour/L of Vancomycin to maximize efficacy and minimize nephrotoxicity
    - MRSA Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis
      - Vancomycin, Gentamicin, and Rifampin
