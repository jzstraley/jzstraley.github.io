- Dopamine Agonists
  - General
    - Psychosis more likely with Dopamine agonists
    - Indicated for RLS/Parkinsons
    - Less likely to produce on-off effect
  - Non-Ergot Alkaloids
    - Pramipexole (Mirapex)
      - MOA: D3 receptor agonist
    - Ropinirole
      - MOA: D2 receptor agonist
      - SE: May exacerbate impulse control disorders
  - Ergot Alkaloid
    - Bromocriptine
      - MOA: Dopamine receptor agonist
- Amantadine
  - MOA: Increased endogenous dopamine release, Inhibits reuptake
- Carbidopa-Levodopa (Sinemet)
  - MOA:
    - Carbidopa: Peripheral DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor
    - Levodopa: Dopamine precursor
  - Acute SE:
    - Increased Peripheral Dopamine: GI distress, Arrythmia, Orthostatic hypotension
    - Increased Central Dopamine: Neuropsych symptoms
  - Chronic SE:
    - Response Fluctuations (wearing-off effect)
      - Not related to dose
    - Dyskinesias (Choreoathetosis) of face and extremities
  - CI: Psychosis
- COMT Inhibitors
  - Tolcapone (Tasmar)
    - CNS active (can cross BBB)
    - Associated with Liver failure
  - Entacapone (Comtan)
    - Not active in CNS
- Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors
  - Galantamine
    - 4mg BID for 4 weeks and re-eval, max is 16mg BID
    - Least expensive, minimal SD
- Pimavanserin (Nuplazid)
  - Dose: 34mg once daily only
  - MOA: Non-dopaminergic atypical antipsychotic via antagonism and inverse agonism at 5HT2A receptors, minimal 5HT2C, no 5HT2B or D2
    - Metabolized CYP3A4 and CYP 3A5
  - Use: Psychosis due to Parkinson Disease, drug induced or regular
    - Reduces hallucinations without worsening parkinsonism
  - SE: Nausea (7%), Constipation (4%), Peripheral Edema (7%), Confusion (6%), possible QTc prolongation
