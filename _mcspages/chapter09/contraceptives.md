  - CI: Thromboembolism, estrogen tumors, active liver disease, pregnancy, uterine bleeding
- Typical Use Effectiveness
  - 1) 3-year Etonogestrel implant: 99.95%
  - 2) Vasectomy: 99.85%
  - 3) Levonorgestrel IUD: 99.8%
  - 4) Female Sterilization: 99.5%
  - 5) Copper-T IUD: 99.2%
  - 6) DMPA: actual 94%, theoretical 99.8%
  - 7) OCPs: actual 91%, theoretical 99%
  - 8) Male Condoms: actual 82%, theoretical 98%
  - 9) Female Condoms: actual 79%, theoretical 95%
- P450 induces, decrease efficacy
  - Phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin
- Postpartum Contraception
  - If \<1 month: Copper IUD or Progestin-only contraception due to risk of VTE and breastfeeding risk with Estrogen
- Age ≥35 and smoker ≥15cigs/day: No estrogen containing drugs
  - Use DMPA
- Progestin Only (Subdermal Implant ≥ Pill)
  - No increase in VTE risk, can be used during breastfeeding
  - Thickens cervical mucus, thins endometrium, inhibits ovulation
  - Suppression of ovulation occurs unpredictably and not in all cycles
  - Must be taken within 3 hours every day
  - Kept up to 3 years, decreases bleeding in 50%, amenorrhea in 20%
  - Unscheduled bleeding is mcc of discontinuation
- Intravaginal Rings (NuvaRing)
  - Inserted for 3 weeks, removed to allow bleeding
  - Increased risk of DVT
  - Release estrogen and progesterone
  - CI: ≥35 and smoke ≥15 cigs/day
- Combined Oral Contraceptive
  - Estrogen/Progestin Contraceptives
    - Suppress ovulation via FSH/LH dampening (no surge)
    - Inhibits ovulation
    - Thickens cervical mucus, thins endometrium, alters uterus, fallopian tube motility
  - Benefits: Endometrial and ovarian cancer risk reduction, menstrual regulation, hyperandrogenism treatment
  - Suppression of ovulation occurs predictably
  - Yaz and Yasmin
    - Contain drospirenone (progestin w/aldosterone antagonist effect to help combat premenstrual bloating
  - Risks: VTEs, Hypertension, Hepatic adenoma, stroke/MI, Cervical Cancer
  - CI: ≥35 and smoke ≥15 cigs/day, Severe HTN (≥160/100), migraine w/aura, breast cancer, liver disease, multiple CVD RF
- Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA)
  - Progesterone only, every 3 months
  - Suppresses pulsatile release of GnRH inhibiting ovulation, thickens cervical mucus, decreases motility of fallopian tube cilia, thins endometrium
  - Good for Sickle cell disease (reduces crises), Epilepsy (intrinsic anticonvulsant)
  - Bad for causing weight gain, unscheduled bleeding, mood changes
- Intrauterine Device
  - Release copper or progesterone
  - Most effective preventative measures
    - 10 year Copper-T or 5-year Levonorgestrel-containing one
  - Avoid copper if anemic or heavy menstrual bleeding
  - CI: Abnormal uterine anatomy, cervical stenosis, leiomyoma, suspected pregnancy, PID in the past, Wilson disease
  - SE: Small risk of abortion, uterine perforation, expulsion
- Subcutaneous Implant
  - Etonogestrel (Nexplanon), slowly releases progesterone over 3 years
  - SE: Irregular bleeding, especially in 1st 6 months
    - Breast pain
- Transdermal Contraceptive Patch

  - Ulipristal
  - Progestin only (Levonorgestrel up to 72)
  - Ethinyl Estradiol + Levonorgestrel (Yuzpe Regimen)
    - 2 pills 12 hours apart within 72 hours
