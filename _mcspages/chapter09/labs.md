  - Produced by yolk sac and fetal liver
  - Elevated in HCC, Metastatic liver cancer, liver cirrhosis, hepatitis, germ cell tumors, yolk sac tumors, ataxia telangiectasia, spherocytosis, pancreatic cancer,
  - False-Positive: gestational diabetes, cigarette smoking, race (higher in black women), viral hepatitis, pregnancy
  - ≥200 is 100% specific for HCC in Cirrhosis
- Albumin

    - Decreased in malnutrition, nephrotic syndrome, acute inflammation, protein-losing enteropathies
    - Microalbumin: Creatine ratio in the urine
      - Best test to screen for initial stages of diabetic nephropathy
      - Dipstick on detects when protein ≥300mg/24h (microalbumin)
  - Hyperalbuminemia
    - 40% of calcium is bound to proteins (mainly albumin)
    - Associated with an increase in total calcium
    - Measure Ionized fraction of Calcium for accurate count

    - No symptoms usually
  - Hypoalbuminemia
    - 1) Decreased Hepatic Synthesis
      - Cirrhosis
    - 2) Increased Urinary or GI loss
      - Nephrotic Syndrome:
        - Periorbital and pedal edema that may progress to generalized edema (anasarca), ascites, and pleural effusions
      - Protein Losing Enteropathy
        - Diarrhea
    - May develop severe intravascular hypovolemia due to over-diuresis and fluid movement into the interstitial spaces

- Bilirubin
  - Function clearance of liver

      - Hemolysis (bilirubin overproduction)
      - Gilbert Syndrome (defective uptake)
      - Crigler-Najjar or newborn (Glucuronyl transferase defect)
    - Obtain Liver Enzymes: Alkaline Phosphatase
      - Increased ALP (Biliary Pathology)
        - Increased GGT/ Increased AST/ALT (Ultrasound/CT)
          - Bile duct obstruction, IBD w/PSC
          - Metabolic Alkalosis in BDO
      - Mildly increased ALP
        - Increased GGT
          - Increased AST/ALT: Hepatocellular Disease
        - Normal GGT
          - Normal Calcium: Paget's disease
  - Increased Conjugated Bilirubin
    - Can't get rid of Bilirubin (extrahepatic dysfunction)
  - Increased Unconjugated Bilirubin
    - Body can't conjugate bilirubin (hepatic dysfunction or RBC breakdown)
    - Hyperbilirubinemia and High LDH
      - Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
      - G6PD deficiency
      - Mechanical RBC destruction
      - Hereditary spherocytosis
      - B12/Folate Deficiency
  - Increased Direct/Conjugated Bilirubin + Cholesterol + alkaline phosphatase
    - Cholestatic pattern
      - Ultrasound (CT)
- BNP
  - Elevated in patients with kidney failure, old age, female
  - Reduced in patients with an elevated BMI
- CA 19-9
  - \<40
  - Associated with Pancreatic cancer, biliary tract cancer
  - Colon, esophageal, hepatic cancers, Pancreatitis, cirrhosis
- CEA (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)
  - \<2.5 in non-smokers, \<5 in smokers, ≥10 is concerning for cancer
  - Associated with tumor burden in colorectal cancer
  - Primary ovarian cancer, Breast cancer, NSCLC, Thyroid cancer, cigarette smoking, cholecystitis, liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, IBD, orlistat, lymphoma, melanoma, PUD, hypothyroidism, biliary obstruction
- Complement
  - Hypocomplementemia

      - Genetic
      - Consumption
      - Underproduction
        - Eclampsia, HELLP syndrome
    - SLE, Vasculitis, RA, infective endocarditis
  - Low C2 or C4: Genetic allele deficiency
  - C3: classical or alternative
  - C4: SLE (classical)
  - CH50: all components of classical
    - Screening for diseases states resulting in hypocomplementemia
- Creatine Kinase (CK)
- Creatine phosphokinase (CPK)
  - Released from muscle tissue as it is damaged
  - Polymyositis, dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis, Duchenne and Becker Muscular dystrophy
- Ceruloplasmin
  - Low
    - High Urinary ceruloplasmin
      - Wilsons
- CRP/ESR
  - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate and C-reactive protein
  - MC APRs used
    - Helpful in determining disease activity and response to therapy
  - Not specific, sensitive with low to moderate pretest probability
    - ESR ≥ 100mm/hr: severe disease (malignancy, infection, vasculitis)
