- Sedative-Hypnotics
  - CNS depression
    - Sedation
    - Hypnosis
    - Anesthesia
    - Coma
- Benzodiazepines
  - MOA: Activate GABAa receptor binding sites
    - Lorazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam are safe in hepatic dysfunction
  - General
    - Anxiolysis, hypnosis, amnesia, no analgesic properties
    - Paradoxical agitation, confusion and aggression within 1 hour of use in elderly
      - Increased cognitive impairment and falls in elderly
    - Withdrawal
      - Life-threatening
        - Increased risk of seizures
        - Anxious and irritable, insomnia, dysphoria, anxiety
        - Begins typically 5-10 days after cessation if long acting, resolve in 2-4 weeks
    - Use Longer half-life benzos to wean off shorter half-life drugs and alcohol

        - "self-taper" by regenerating deficient brain receptors
    - Overdose with alcohol (sedative-hypnotic overdose)
      - Synergistic respiratory depression when combined with opiates
      - Bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression, CNS depression, lethargy, somnolence, hyporeflexia
      - Flumazenil to treat OD
  - Short (half-life \<6h):
    - Triazolam (Halcion)
      - Insomnia
    - Oxazepam (Serax)
      - Limited first pass metabolism, "Outside The Liver"
    - Midazolam (Versed)
      - Used for sedation during medical procedures
      - Flumazenil to reverse
      - SE: Decreased RR, hypotension, somnolence, hiccups, bronchospasm
    - Clorazepate (Tranxene)
      - Adjunct in management of partial seizures
  - Intermediate (half-life 6-24h):
    - Alprazolam (Xanax)
      - Tmax: 1-2 hours, Half-Life: 12-15 hours
      - Depression, panic disorder, SAD
      - Medium strength (~1mg of Xanax = 2mg Ativan)
      - Sedation: 0.25-0.5mg BID-TID
    - Lorazepam (Ativan)
      - Tmax: 1-6 hours, Half-Life: 10-20 hours
      - Psychotic agitation, alcohol withdrawal, acute control of seizures
      - Only IM benzodiazepine
      - Weakest
      - Sedation: 1-2mg daily to BID
      - Hypnosis: 2-4mg
      - Limited first pass metabolism, "Outside The Liver"
    - Temazepam (Restoril)
      - Insomnia
      - Alprazolam has more euphoria, less sedation
      - Limited first pass metabolism, "Outside The Liver"
  - Long (half-life ≥24h):
    - Diazepam (Valium)
      - Tmax: 1-2 hours, Half-Life: 20-80 hours
      - Muscle relaxation, analgesia, seizures, alcoholic withdrawal (seizures)
    - Clonazepam (Klonopin)`
      - Seizures, mania, SAD, panic disorder, OCD
      - Strongest strength (~1mg of Klonopin = 2-4mg Ativan)
      - Used for sleep due to longer half life
      - q4hrs prn for CIWA
    - Chlordiazepoxide (Librium)
      - Tmax: 2-4 hours, Half-Life: 15-40 hours
      - Alcohol withdrawal (particularly for agitation)
    - Flurazepam (Dalmane)
      - Insomnia
- Barbiturates
  - Phenobarbital
    - Can be used in Crigler-Najjar II to induce UDP-glucuronyl transferase
    - Sedation: 15-30mg BID to TID
- Promethazine (Phenegran)
  - SE: Marked sedation, antiemetic
- Diphenhydrinate (Dramamine)
- Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)
- Hydroxyzine Pamoate (Atarax, Vistaril)
  - SE: Marked Sedation
- Cyclizine (Marezine)
- Meclizine (Bonine)
- Doxylamine
  - Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy
- Ramelteon (Rozerem)
  - MOA: MT1 agonist (promotes sleep onset), MT2 agonist (shift timing of circadian system) that improves sleep onset
    - Selective melatonin agonist (MT1 and MT2 selective)
  - Use: Insomnia
    - Good for sleep maintenance
    - DELIRIA-J (2014) – Substantial reduction in the risk of developing delirium in elderly inpatients (65-85) when given nightly for 7 days.
  - No tolerance or dependence
- Suvorexant (Belsomra)
- Non-Benzo GABA-A Receptor Agonists
  - Non-Benzo GABA-A Receptor Agonists

      - Alpha 1 subunit selective
    - Zaleplon (Sonata)
      - Initial insomnia (non-benzo), 1hour action, sleep onset insomnia
      - Short, insomnia
      - Sleep Initiation
      - Rapid onset, reduces hang-over effect
      - SE: Dizziness and Somnolence
    - Zolpidem (Ambien)
      - Dsoe: Max 5mg females, 10mg males
      - Use: Insomnia
        - ER version good for sleep maintenance
        - Reduces sleep latency, nocturnal awakenings
          - Increases total sleep time
          - 1-4.5 hours, sleep onset or maintenance
      - SE: Anterograde amnesia
        - Can't be used if patient has ever sleepwalked

      - MOA: 5HT1a partial agonist
        - Takes 2 weeks to work
        - Increased grapefruit increases buspar concentrations
      - Use: Anxiety, GAD
        - Non-sedating, no anticonvulsant or muscle relaxant properties
        - Useful in alcoholics due to the lack of CNS potentiation
        - Can be used in bruxism and Sexual side effects (inhibits 5HT2 and agonizes DA)
      - SE: headache, nausea, dizziness
