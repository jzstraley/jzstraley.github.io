- Result of widespread response to antigen
  - Massive release of histamine and other substances from mast cells and basophils
- Triggers:
  - Food (nuts and shellfish), Latex, (B-lactams), Stings
    - Short term Foleys have latex
- Widespread IgE-mediated response to an allergen
  - Type 1 Hypersensitivity
  - Typically occurs in individuals with previous or repeated exposure
- Rapid-onset hypersensitivity reaction that is characterized by respiratory compromise (Wheezing, stridor, bronchospasm), rash (urticarial rash, flushing, hives, pruritus, erythema, wheals) and decreased blood pressure (systemic vasodilation)
  - +/- Oropharyngeal and laryngeal edema
  - Vasodilation (Hypotension and tissue edema), tachycardia
  - Upper airway edema (stridor/hoarseness), bronchospasm (wheezing)
    - Rhinoconjunctivitis, poor organ perfusion, dyspnea
  - Nausea, Vomiting, Abdominal pain
- Life threatening: Airway obstruction due to circulatory collapse (shock)
  - Severe dyspnea, labored breathing, tachypnea
    - Intubate
- Treatment
  - 1) IM Epinephrine
    - Prevents hypotension, upper airway edema
    - IV Epinephrine if no response
      - Higher risk of cardiac arrhythmia thus 2nd line
  - 2) Respiratory Support (airway management and resuscitation)
  - 3) IV Fluids
  - +/- Antihistamines, glucocorticoids
