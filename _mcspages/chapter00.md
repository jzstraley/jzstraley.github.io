#### Notes
- When evaluating a patient, always try to figure out *why*
- In a perfect world, very few patients (if any) would actually need medications
    - This is why whenever I evaluate a patient, I always ask if a medication could be the cause of the patient's presenting problem. As physicians, we don't ask ourselves enough if the medications we prescribe are causing the problem we see
        - This is especially true when reviewing labs
