1. General (Important)
    - If you're here, you’re not lost. If you do get lost, reference:
        - [New Hire Locations][1]
    - Email Tutorial: Microsoft Office/Outlook/OneDrive/SharePoint
        - Email, Lists, Resources
    - See the CAMC Staff Handbook and Resident Orientation & Benefits books located in the Intern Guide folder for more information on the Basics of CAMC
        - Rotation Curriculum Guides
    - Work/Call Schedules
        - Accessed via AMION and can be downloaded to your calendar
        - Morning Report/Didactic Calendar
    - [New Innovations][2]
        - Where your onboarding was completed, where you will be logging you duty hours, signing into lecture, seeing your block schedule, completing evaluations and curriculum reviews
        - Duty Hour Tutorial: [Logging Duty Hours on New Innovations][3]
    - Duty Hours
        - Unfortunately, Very High Yield*
        - High Points:
            - Must be logged every 72 hours per CAMC
                - You will get emails if you forget or don’t log them
                    - You will then get a text from katie to log them
                        - Then people get mad (So just do them)
            - Try not to break 80 hours
                - This is averaged over an entire month
                    - Ex. 90 for 3 weeks and 30 hours for 1 week = 60 hours/week
                - Ex. 12 days on, 2 days off, 12 days on, 2 days off = average of 4 days off
            - You may get close to breaking duty hours on ICU
                - BEFORE you break hours, contact a Chief Resident/Attending so arrangements can be made to allow you time off
        - Reference Duty Hour Guidelines Document


2. General (Slightly Less Important)
