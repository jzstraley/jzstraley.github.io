Sign up for a picture time slot by April 24th

<!--more-->

- We are starting to update our website for the upcoming year! One of the projects we want to do is get new photos of each resident to put beside your bios, in place of the blurry badge photos that CAMC provides.
    - We will be taking these photos on May 4th and May 8th from 1-4pm. Location TBD but somewhere around Memorial. 
    - Please use the email link to sign up for a picture time slot by April 24th.
- Also â€“ we need to update our scholarly activity tab (https://www.camcmedicine.edu/academic-departments/department-internal-medicine/internal-medicine-residency-program/program-0). 
- Please review it and email me back anything that you have completed that needs added ASAP.
