- Transfers (Accepting team)
	1. Like admitting a patient, but slightly less work as the patient has already been on another service, such as the ICU, but not always the case *cough cough surgery cough*
		a. Do not make the type "Transfer Note" you are unable to see this note when you do this
	2. Transfer Note (To Med Service)
		a. Type: Internal Medicine Progress Note
		b. Note Template: Progress/SOAP Note - Brief
		c. Title: "WVU IM Transfer Note"
	3. Update Excel List Online
- Transfers (Releasing team)
	1. If you are on the ICU and you are transferring a patient to the medicine service, contact the medicine service senior or MAO to transfer the patient
	2. Other than a standard progress note, no extra note needs to be written if you are the "discharging" team
	3. If you are on the medicine service and transferring to the ICU, a short progress note about the patient's decompensation should be written.
        - The ICU team will write an ICU Admission note rather than transfer note because it's special
