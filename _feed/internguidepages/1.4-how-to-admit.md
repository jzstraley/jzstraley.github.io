- General
	- Generally, the medicine service admits from the ED
		- Check the Cap Rules to determine if there is enough room for the patient to be staffed
	- If the patient needs ICU level care, speak with your senior and see who the patient follows with as an outpatient:
		- Generally, 3 options:
			- 1) WVU Pulmonology
			- 2) PAC (Pulmonary Associates of Charleston)
			- 3) No Pulmonologist doctor or Unknown (Unassigned)

- 4 main steps:
	1. PSO
	2. Admission Orders
	3. Medication Reconciliation (Admission)
	4. H&P Note
  
1. PSO
2. Place Admission Order Set (Adult Admission)
	1. There is a lot to this, so it is important to do this with your senior
3. Medication Reconciliation (often not done in the ER)
	- Go over which medications you wish to continue with the Senior Resident
		- If you are unable to complete the “Reconciliation,” complete the “Document Medication by Hx” located immediately beside the Reconciliation (See below)
		- Ideally, this should already be done in the ER, but sometimes it is not. Make sure to ask the patient their medications to complete this step
    - Place Additional Orders if needed
4. Type Admission Note (See Below)
	- Add Problems to the problem list if not already done
