- General
	1. Personally, my favorite shifts due to the increased independence and responsibility
        - Always remember, when in doubt, call a senior. It is their job to help you
        - For additional Questions
			i. Rotation Curriculum Guides 
        - Generally, nights consist of admission and managing med service floor patient problems
            - Interns generally carry the medicine service pager and respond to pages with the help of their senior
            - Admission H & Ps should be sent to the senior for their addendum
	2. Night Rotation “Nights”:
        - Start on a Sunday Night and goes through Thursday night for a total of 5 nights
        - Weekdays (Sunday night-Thursday night): Receive Checkout @730pm in the call team’s workroom
        - Checkout to the on-call day team at 6am, then rotate to the post and pre call teams
        - Morning Report at 8am on Monday and Tuesday morning; see link for more info
	3. Each team, Senior + intern (Night 1 team) AND Senior (Night 2 lone senior), can admit up to 5 patients nightly before ‘capping’ to un-assigned patients {total 10 before capping to unassigned} 
        - Admit patients to the on-call team until capped, then admit to the post call team
        - Pre-call team is protected from admissions
            - Bounce backs are sent to the pre-call team in the morning if needed.
	4. Night Float:
        - Includes Friday and Saturday Night for a total of 2 nights, hence the “Float”
            - Receive Checkout @1930 in the call team’s workroom
            - Admit patients to the on-call team until capped, then admit to the post call team
            - Pre-call team is protected from admissions
                - Bounce backs are sent to the pre-call team in the morning if needed.
        - Checkout to the on-call day team at 7am, then rotate to the post and pre call teams
            - No morning report, however, checkout is 1 hour later
