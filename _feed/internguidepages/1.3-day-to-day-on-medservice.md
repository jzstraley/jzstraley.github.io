1. How to Write a Progress Note
2. Cap Rules
4. How to Present on IM Rounds

- General:
	- Also called "Med Service" or "Service" for short, the Medicine Service is a 4 week rotation block (for interns) of inpatient internal medicine
	- The point of the medicine service is to work as a team to take care of sick patients
	- Ask! 
		- Questions
			- The whole point of residency is to learn and this is one of the best ways to do that
		- Feedback
			- Getting feedback is important in figuring out how you can make yourself a better doctor
				- I generally asked my attendings after a few days for feedback to make sure I was going in the right direction
			- Asking for feeback also shows you care about being a better doctor which show dedication and effort (both important)
		- About Readings
			- Not everything can be taught in one day, this is why it is important to get the resources of your peers/mentors so you can track down the source of their information and critically analyze it for yourself
	- To do before or on Day 1:
		- Have the senior for the team share the Team lists with you on Cerner
		- Have your senior’s number and call them if you have questions or can’t reach via AMS

- Day-to-Day for Seniors:
	- Use of [ABCD][1]:
		- A: Pts who are acutely ill or worsening quickly, “watcher” status, or never seen together as a team
		- B: Pts responding to therapies but still require updates to care and ongoing hospitalization
		- C: Pts pending discharge that are not able to be discharged for some defined reason (i.e., EOT for antibiotics, HD chair, placement)
		- D: Pts anticipated for discharge

- Day-to-Day for Interns:
	1. Checkout from Night Team
        - Senior to determine each intern’s patients for the day
        	- Let your senior know if you have afternoon clinic
        - Morning Labs/Follow-up items
        	- Check Morning Labs as well as any follow up items from the day prior
        		- Start “Lab” & ”Box” System if desired; See Staying Organized
        	- Replace relevant electrolytes/start new meds as needed
        		- See “Electrolyte Replacement Guidelines” or follow the OG link: MCVU
				Discuss with senior if needed
	2. Pre-Rounds
	3. Morning Report
	4. Rounds
	5. Lunch
	6. Didactics
	7. Post-Didactics
	8. Handoffs
		1. Please try your hardest to update hospital courses
			I. This is especially important for discharges, end of the rotation handoff, and patients in the hospital longer than one week
