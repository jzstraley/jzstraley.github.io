- General:
	- Also called "Med Service" or "Service" for short, the Medicine Service is a 4 week rotation block (for interns) of inpatient internal medicine
		- The point of the medicine service is to work as a team to take care of sick patients
	- [Expectations][5]
	- Ask! 
		- Questions
			- The whole point of residency is to learn and this is one of the best ways to do that
		- Feedback
			- Getting feedback is important in figuring out how you can make yourself a better doctor
				- I generally asked my attendings after a few days for feedback to make sure I was going in the right direction
			- Asking for feeback also shows you care about being a better doctor which show dedication and effort (both important)
		- About Readings
			- Not everything can be taught in one day, this is why it is important to get the resources of your peers/mentors so you can track down the source of their information and critically analyze it for yourself
	- To do before or on Day 1:
		- Have the senior for the team share the Team lists with you on Cerner
		- Get your senior’s number and call them if you have questions or can’t reach them via AMS
