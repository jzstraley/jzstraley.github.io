- Patients admitted after midnight do not need a progress note for that day
- Must have Date of Service, CC, PMH, FH, SH
	- In the HPI, you should be commending on things such as status overnight, complaints, procedures/updates, nutrition, bowel movements, urine output<br>
	- <span style ="color:purple;">Ex. “No acute events overnight. Pt reports continued upset stomach to the point she did not eat dinner last night. She also states she had 2 small-caliber loose bowel movements but denies change in urinary output. She is anxious about the possibility of a procedure today”</span>
- Problems List
	-  List of Diagnosis
		- Generally ordered from 1 to X with #1 being the reason the patient is in the hospital
			- As you progress down your problem list, you should add on the chronic problems the patient has that you are treating while the are in the hospital
			- Ideally, you would list every problem you are giving medication, even their home meds
		- Ex. 
			- 1) Acute COPD Exacerbation (Presenting Diagnosis)
			- 2) Type 2 Diabetes (Chronic)
			- 3) Hypothyroidism (Chronic)
			- 4) Preventive Measure (Prophylaxis)
- **PAST/PRESENT/FUTURE GAME for A & P:**
	- Relative guide for assessment documentation
	- PAST: Relevant PMH to the specific problem (NOT EVERYTHING THAT WAS DONE WHILE HOSPITALIZED)
	- PRESENT: What you are CURRENTLY doing for the problem
	- FUTURE: Changes moving forward or what needs to be done in the future
	- GAME: See if the attending likes it (good luck)<br>
