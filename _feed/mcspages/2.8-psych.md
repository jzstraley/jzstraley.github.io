# [Chapter 3 – Aging, Death, Bereavement](#_top)

- Neurochemical changes that occur in aging
  - include decreased availability of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, dopamine, G-aminobutyric acid, and acetyl- choline;
  - increased availability of monoamine oxidase; and
  - decreased responsiveness of neurotransmitter receptors.
    - These changes can be associated with psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety.
  - Although learning speed may decrease, in the absence of brain disease, intelligence remains approximately the same throughout life.
  - Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in the elderly.

- According to Dr. Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, the process of dying involves five stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance (Dang BaD Act).
- Normal grief generally subsides after 1 year, although some features may continue longer. Even after they have subsided, symptoms may return on holidays or special occasions (the "anniversary reaction").
- Physicians often feel a sense of failure at not preventing the death of a patient. They may deal with this sense by becoming emotionally detached from thee patient.

# [Chapter 4 – Genetics, Anatomy, Biochemistry](#_top)

- Bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder recently have been associated with markers on chromosomes 3, 5 and 6
- The cerebral hemispheres are connected by the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, hippocampal commissure and the habenular commissure.
  - Women may have a larger corpus callosum and anterior commissure and appear to have better interhemispheric communication than men.
  - Men may have better-developed right hemispheres and appear to be more adept at spatial tasks than women.
- The PNS carries sensory information to the CNS and motor information away from the CNS
- Secondary messengers: cAMP, Diacylglycerol, Ca2+, and NO
- Dopamine
  - Catecholamine, tyrosine is converted to the dopamine precursor via tyrosine hydroxylase.
  - The nigrostriatal tract is involved in the regulation of muscle tone and movement.
    - Substantia nigra to the basal ganglia
    - This tract degenerates in Parkinson's
    - Antipsychotics can block postsynaptic dopamine receptors = Parkinson's like symptoms
    - Extrapyramidal symptoms/NMS: Acute dystonia, akathisia, parkinson's
  - Dopamine acts on the tuberoinfundibular tract to inhibit the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary.
    - Antipsychotics can block postsynaptic dopamine receptors which disinhibits prolactin
      - Gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction, and infertility
  - The mesolimbic–mesocortical tract is associated with psychotic disorders.
    - It extends from the ventral tegmental area to the limbic system
    - Decreased dopamine here is why antipsychotics work
    - Hyperactivity of the mesolimbic tract is associated with the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.
      - Dopamine from the ventral tegmental area through the nucleus accumbens and through the limbic system
        - Stimulated in response to pleasurable events
    - Hypoactivity of the mesocortical tract is associated with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
- Norepinephrine
  - Catecholamine plays a role in mood, anxiety, arousal, learning, and memory.
  - Dopamine β-hydroxylase, present in noradrenergic neurons, converts this dopamine to norepinephrine.
  - Most noradrenergic neurons are located in the locus ceruleus.
- Serotonin, an indolamine, plays a role in mood, sleep, sexuality, and impulse control.
  - Elevation of serotonin is associated with improved mood and sleep but decreased sexual function
  - Tryptophan is converted to serotonin
  - Most serotonergic cell bodies in the brain are contained in the dorsal raphe nucleus in the upper pons and lower midbrain
- Histamine – ethylamine
  - Blockade leads to sedation and increased appetite
- Acetylcholine (Ach), a quaternary amine, is the transmitter used by nerve–skeleton–muscle junctions.
  - The nucleus basalis of Meynert is a brain area involved in production of Ach.
  - Blocking the action of AchE with drugs such as donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (Reminyl) may delay the progression of Alzheimer's disease but cannot reverse the function already lost.
  - Blockade of muscarinic Ach receptors with drugs such as antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants results in the classic "anticholinergic" adverse effects seen with the use of these drugs, including dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary hesitancy, and constipation. Use of these agents can also result in central anticholinergic effects such as confusion and memory problems.
  - Initiation of erection is primarily via Parasympathetic function mediated by acetylcholine
    - Anticholinergics can block this
- These neurotransmitters are involved in most synapses in the brain and include glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glycine.
  - Glutamate – excitatory neurotransmitter
    - Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, blocks calcium influx which prevents never cell degeneration and excitotoxicity death in Alzheimer's
  - GABA – principal inhibitory neurotransmitter, requires B6
    - Benzos and barbiturates increase the affinity for GABA for its binding site which allows more chloride into the neuron.
    - Leads to inhibition which decreases anxiety
  - Glycine – inhibitory neurotransmitter, mainly in the spinal cord

-

# [Chapter 5 – Psychiatric Symptom Assessment](#_top)

- Drug-assisted interview
  - Administration of a sedative, such as amobarbital sodium ("the Amytal interview"), prior to the clinical interview may be use ul in determining whether organic pathology is responsible or symptomatology in patients who exhibit certain psychiatric disorders or are malingering.
  - Sedatives can relax patients with conditions such as dissociative disorders, conversion disorder, and other disorders involving high levels of anxiety and mute psychotic states. This will allow patients to express themselves coherently during the interview.
  - Intravenous (IV) administration of sodium lactate (lactate infusion) can provoke panic attacks in susceptible patients and can thus help to identify individuals with panic disorder. Inhalation of carbon dioxide can produce the same effect.
    - Amygdala responds to low pH and helps control fear response
- Galvanic skin response (a component of the "lie detector" test)
  - The electric resistance o skin (galvanic skin response) varies with the patient's psychological state.
  - Higher sweat gland activity, seen with sympathetic nervous system arousal (e.g., when lying), results in decreased skin resistance and a positive test. However, innocent but anxious people may also have positive tests (false positives) and guilty people who are not bothered by telling lies may have negative tests (false negatives).

# [Chapter 6 – Psychoanalytic Theory and Defense Mechanisms](#_top)

| Key Defense Mechanisms |
| --- |
| Immature |
- Acting Out: Expressing unacceptable feelings through actions
- Denial: Behaving as if an aspect of reality does not exist, unable to accept
- Displacement: Transferring feelings to less threatening object/person
- Intellectualization: Focusing on non-emotional aspects to avoid distressing feelings, avoids
- Passive Aggression: Avoiding conflict by expressing hostility covertly
- Projection: Attributing one's own feeling to others
- Rationalization: Justifying behavior to avoid difficult truths
- Reaction formation: Transforming unacceptable feelings/impulses into the opposite
- Regression: Reverting to earlier developmental stage
- Splitting: Experiencing a person/situation as either all positive or all negative
 |
| Mature |
- Sublimation: Channeling impulses into socially acceptable behaviors
- Suppression: Putting unwanted feelings aside to cope with reality, consciously ignoring thoughts to achieve a goal
- Altruism
- Humor
 |

- Mature defense mechanisms (e.g., altruism, humor, sublimation, and suppression), when used in moderation, directly help the patient or others.
- Repression: pushing unacceptable emotions into the unconscious, is the basic defense mechanism on which all others are based. Subconscious choice
- Identification: A person's personality is molded after that of a parent or authority figure
- Transference: Emotions a patient may feel towards a treating physician
- Countertransference: Refers to the emotions in the treating individual that may be triggered by a patient
- Mature, Neurotic, and Immature
  1. Mature: Sublimation and Suppression
