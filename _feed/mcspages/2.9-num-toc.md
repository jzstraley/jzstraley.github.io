### [Antihypertensives](#_top)

- Physiology
  - RAAS disturbances can play a large role in hypertension development

      - Beta1 blockers inhibit sympathetic activation of kidney
    - Renin is produced in the JG cells of the kidney in response to hypoperfusion, B1 stimulation, renal artery stenosis, diuretic use
      - Direct Renin inhibitors stop renin
    - Renin leaves the kidney to cleave angiotensinogen (made in the liver) into angiotensin I
    - Angiotensin Converting Enzyme in the pulmonary capillary endothelium converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II and inactivates Bradykinin
      - ACE Inhibitors
    - Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor, also promotes aldosterone production in the adrenal cortex
      - Angiotensin II blockers inhibit Angiotensin II from working on the type 1 receptor on the vascular bed and the adrenal cortex. This prevents aldosterone production and vasoconstriction
    - Aldosterone acts on the principle cells of collecting ducts in the nephron to increase renal sodium and water absorption
      - Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists prevent this
    - Therefore, any drug that blocks angiotensin II or aldosterone promotes natriuresis
      - Sodium resorption and vasoconstriction blockade decreases hypertension
    - The end result of RAAS activation is increased blood pressure, total body sodium and water, and blood volume
- Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs)
  - MOA: Inhibit the conversion of Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II
    - ATII (vasoconstrictor, stimulates aldosterone release)
    - Systemic arteriolar dilation, urine sodium loss, intravascular volume loss
  - Also inhibit bradykinin degradation, induce vasodilatory prostaglandin production, reduce SNS activity
    - Chronic nonproductive chough within 1 week of initiation or dosage increase (will be more delayed)
  - Reduce systemic BP and directly modify the permeability of the glomerular epithelium (decrease protein loss)
    - Lowering intraglomerular pressure and reducing protein excretion
      - Great for Hypertension + Protein CKD
    - Reduce the amount of aldosterone acting on DT, sodium loss
  - Slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy
  - Cardioprotective and reduce ventricular remodeling after ischemia

- Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARBs)

  - Do not decrease Angiotensin II levels, but do cause natriuresis and decreased aldosterone production
- Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blockers (BBs, Beta Blockers)

    - Beta1 blockers block sympathetic stimulation of the JG apparatus in the kidney
