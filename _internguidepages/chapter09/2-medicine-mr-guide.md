- General
	- Everything you learned from before, forget it
	- Pick out the most interesting case you've had this week
		- Generally, Interns will present the case with the assistance of their Attending +/- Senior Resident
	- Present as if you are presenting a UWorld stem but without the answer options
		- See Layout below
	- The game is to present the patient in such a way that the audience is given an open-ended question for discussion with a short presentation at the end
- General Presentation Layout
	- Name, age, and chief complaint
		- “We have a 62 y/o F who presented to the ED overnight with the chief complaint of chest pain”
	- HPI/ROS/SH
		- “She states she’s had one day of left substernal chest pain that she says began when she went to get her newspaper this morning. She states the pain radiated down her left arm and characterized this pain as a dull squeeze. She states when she stopped walking, the chest pain subsided. Nitroglycerin given in the ambulance made her chest pain better, walking made it worse.”
		- “ROS was otherwise pertinently positive for fatigue, new shortness of breath, cough, orthopnea, leg swelling, diarrhea, and anxiety. She denied fever, sputum production, syncope, BRBPR, and depression.”
		- “She drinks alcohol occasionally, has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years, and denies illicit drug use. She has no difficulty with her ADLs at baseline.”
	- PMH/PSH
		- “She has a relevant PMH of 4 vessel CABG 3 years ago, well-controlled T2DM, and COPD on room air. Her only other surgery was a cholecystectomy 30 years ago”
	- Meds/Allergies
		- “For medications she currently takes aspirin 81mg, Lipitor 80mg, and Coreg 3.25mg daily. She denies OTC/Herbal Meds. She has no known allergies”
	- STOP (Ask about questions)
		- “Before I move on to the Vitals and Exam, what questions do you have?”
	- ER Vitals
		- “In the ED, she was found to be afebrile, BP 140/80, HR 58, RR 18 w/SpO2 99% on room air.”
	- Physical Exam
		- “On physical exam, she was found to be clutching her chest and in mild distress. She was bradycardic w/regular rhythm and was without murmurs or gallops. Chest was CTAB without wheezing, rales, or rhonchi. Abdomen was soft, non-tender to palpation w/normal bowel sounds. She had trace pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities without erythema.”
	- STOP (Ask about questions)
		- “Anything else about the exam you all want to know?”
	- Labs
		- Usually shown on the computer, pertinent positives/negatives
		- “Labs were relevant for a Cr of 1.8, Troponins of 10230 which trended up to 12320, and a BNP of 2.”
	- Imaging
		- Usually walk through together
		- “EKG was significant for ST segment elevation in the inferior leads with reciprocal changes. CXR was without abnormality. CTA chest for PE was negative.”
	- STOP (Ask about questions)
		- Let them ask questions but try not to give the answer away (usually already answered by now).
	- Short Presentation by the Attending about the Interesting part of the case
		- Ex. CIEDs
- Tips
	- Keeping the audience's attention is key
