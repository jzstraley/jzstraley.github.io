- Day to Day:
	- Checkout starts 6:00 am sharp in the 2nd floor call room found across from the side entrance to the MICU
		- Interns do up to 4 TOTAL 24-hour shifts per ICU
			w Your schedule will look something like: Five 12-hour days working with the 5th day being a 24-hour shift. This is followed by 48 hours off before repeating the cycle
	- Pre-Rounding
		- Use the first page of the ICU Daily Progress Note Sheets provided or print them off from within the ICU folder FOR EACH PATIENT
		- Quickly check morning labs and try to see your patients before nurse shift change for the best checkout from overnight
			- Replace electrolytes as you're checking daily labs for your patients if you can
			- Refer to the "[Electrolyte Replacement Guidelines][1]" if needed for help
		- ICU Daily Progress Note
			- Type: Critical Care Progress Note
			- Note Template: Critical Care Daily Progress Note
			- Title: “CAMC IM Critical Care Daily Progress Note”
	- Admissions
		- Unlike the medicine service, the ICU service typically admits patients 24 hours a day
			- Because of this, checking to see whether patients are assigned vs. unassigned is even more important
				- The difference here is between CAMC Pulmonology (Dr. Ihle, Dr. Terla, Dr. Adkins, Dr. Morehead, etc..) vs. Pulmonology Associates of Charleston (PAC, Dr. Cox, Dr. Eggleston, etc…)
				- One of the first questions your should ask patients is who their pulmonologist is. If it is a PAC provider, the patient should be given to their service
					- Checking the chart can be useful, so can the WVHIN (see other)
		- ICU Admission Note
			- Type: History and Physical 
			- Note Template: Critical Care Admission H&P

	- Rounding
		- Typically starts after 9:15am, attending dependent (Ex. Dr. Morehead likes to pre-round with the senior residents and fellow somewhere between 7:30am-8am and then table round at 9:15am with the whole team)
	- Daily Tasks
		- After rounds, follow up on topics/orders done during rounds
		- Re-round with your senior (or alone) frequently on your patients as things in the ICU change frequently
