			3. Pulm/Crit Fellow
			4. 1-2 Senior Residents
			5. 2-4 Interns (usually 2 from IM and 2 from ER or FM)
			6. Medical Students
        - Interns typically take anywhere from 2-5 patients daily to round on
			1. The patients are complex and you need to have a system to keep up with it all
    - Day-to-Day on the ICU
