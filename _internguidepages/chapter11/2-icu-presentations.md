- How you are to present on the ICU service is very dependent on the attending
- Some attendings prefer presentations like the once explained in IV. How to Present on IM Rounds while other attendings prefer a Systems Based presentation (Below)
	- Overall, similar to the IM presentation, however it differs due to the complexity, additional parameters (such as mechanical ventilation) and how the Assessment and Plan are presented
- For the beginning of this, follow the ICU Daily Progress Note Sheets mentioned on the previous page
- For the Assessment and Plan, follow a "head to toe" Systems Based format
	- Ex. Systems Based Assessment and Plan
		a. Neuro
			i. Altered Mental Status
				1) Likely 2/2 Septic Shock from MRSA PNA, Moderately sedated w/RASS -2, SAT daily
		b. CV
			i. Shock, Septic
				1) 2/2 MRSA PNA, continue cefepime and zyvox for broad coverage D#5
			ii. NSTEMI
				1) Type 2 2/2 ARF, troponins downtrending today, cards w/no plan for intervention
		c. Resp
			i. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
				1) 2/2 MRSA PNA, Intubated, sedated, mechanically ventilated, will attempt SBT today
		d. GI
