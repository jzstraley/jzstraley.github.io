- General
    - Basics
        - Very difficult rotation, but can be very rewarding and fun
			1. One of the most time-intensive rotations and one of the few times I was close to breaking duty hours
        - The ICU team is generally larger than the other services due to how intensive it is
			1. Attending
			2. Pharmacist: Kelsey Hall, PharmD +/- Pharmacy Resident
			3. Pulm/Crit Fellow
			4. 1-2 Senior Residents
			5. 2-4 Interns (usually 2 from IM and 2 from ER or FM)
			6. Medical Students
        - Interns typically take anywhere from 2-5 patients daily to round on
			1. The patients are complex and you need to have a system to keep up with it all
