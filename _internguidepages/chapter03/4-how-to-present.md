- General
	- I am not the best presenter, but the way I've been yelled at the least (and asked the least number of questions) is by following a simple flow I found on the internet
	- This does not apply presenting in the ICU
		- How to Present on the ICU

- For a new patient (this will be annoyingly long)
	1. Patient Info + PMH/PSH/SH/FH if relevant + Chief Complaint
		> <p class="text-primary"> "Mr. John Doe is a 50 year old male with a past medical history of COPD on 2 liters baseline and 30 pack year smoking who presented to the ER last night with the chief complaint of a productive cough for the past 6 days."
	2. (Relevant background history If applicable)
		> <p class="text-success"> "Relevantly, the patient states he was seen at an Urgent care in Beckley 2 days ago for this cough where he was diagnosed with an Acute Heart Failure Exacerbation for which he was given Lasix and sent home."
	3. HPI + Relevant ROS
		> <p class="text-danger"> "He states he's had a new moderately productive cough with dark green sputum that he says has not improved with mucinex or lasix. Nothing has seemed to make his cough worse. He complains of associated increased shortness of breath, mild pleuritic chest pain, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. He denied hemoptysis, orthopnea, leg swelling, nausea, or vomiting"
	4. Brief ER Course (3 parts)
		1. Vitals
		> <p class="text-info"> "In the ED, the patient was found to be afebrile, blood pressure 108/90, heart rate 98, and respiratory rate 24 with oxygen saturation 87 percent on his baseline 2 liters supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula with improvement to 94% on 4 liters"
		2. Exam(if useful)/Abnormal Labs/Diagnostic Workup
		> <p class="text-warning"> "He exhibited increased work of breathing and mild respiratory distress on moderate exertion, but not at rest. Initial labs were relevant for a hemoglobin of 11.0 and potassium of 3.3. His chest x-ray showed worsening hyperinflation without focal consolidation or infiltrate. His mini-viral panel was negative and his respiratory panel was pending when seen."
		3. Working Diagnosis/Interventions
		> <p class="text-primary"> "For a suspected Acute exacerbation of COPD, he was started on IV Vancomycin and Zosyn by the ER. He was additionally given 2 liters of normal saline for dehydration related to his diarrhea. He was admitted last night by our service for AECOPD due to his elevated risk of acute respiratory failure in the setting of mild respiratory distress on exertion, increased work of breathing, and increased oxygen requirement."
	5. Overnight Events (with vitals/focused exam/labs)
		> <p class="text-success"> "No acute events overnight. Today, the patient states he feels some better with a decrease in sputum production since yesterday. He states his breathing is minimally improved. He said his appetite has improved some and he has been without diarrhea overnight. Nursing staff noting one well formed bowel movement this morning. He remains afebrile and vitally stable with BP 109/82, HR 80, and RR 17 with his SpO2 now 95% on 3L NC. On exam, the patient appears comfortable without evidence of sputum production overnight. He is without distress on exertion. Heart was regular, rate and rhythm, lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without rales/rhonchi/wheezing, abdomen was soft, non-tender, and without guarding or rigidity. He has no leg swelling bilaterally. Labs were relatively the same today with a hemoglobin of 11.1 and potassium of 3.3. Respiratory panel obtained last night returned positive this morning for H. Influenzae."
	6. Assessment and Plan
		> <p class="text-danger"> "Assessment and Plan, Number 1 is AECOPD due to H. Influenzae. His increased cough severity and sputum production make it highly likely he has AECOPD, but his clear CXR suggests against this being a pneumonia. For this we should stop the IV Vanc and Zosyn started in the ER, start him on a SABA such as albuterol, add on oral prednisone 40mg for the next 5 days, and put him on an antibiotic tailored to his respiratory panel such as Azithromycin for the next 5 days. Prior to starting the Azithromycin, I'd like to get an EKG to make sure his QTc is not prolonged. I also think we should consider getting an ABG to assess his acid-base profile if his status worsens. Number 2 is Hypokalemia. I believe this is related to his diarrhea, which has resolved, and I'd like to give him 40 mEq of oral potassium this afternoon. Number 3 is Unspecified Anemia. The patient has had extensive workup with his PCP for this problem, as seen in the chart, and it appears to be stable over the past 5 years, with his hemoglobin being 10.9 in 2017. I plan to observe this problem for now. Number 4 are our preventative measures. He is on DVT prophylaxis with Lovenox for his PADUA score of 6. Overall, my disposition for this patient is for him to remain inpatient today due to his persistent shortness of breath and increased oxygen requirement with likely discharge tomorrow."

- For an old patient (from the example above, may be shorting depending on attending)
	1. Patient Info + Brief history + Primary Assessment(s)
		> <p class="text-warning"> "Mr. Doe is our 50 year old male with a history of COPD who we are treating for AECOPD secondary to H. Influenzae."
	2. Day's Events (with vitals/exam/labs)
		> <p class="text-primary"> "Nursing reported no acute events overnight. Today he states his sputum has decreased in quantity and is now without color. He states he feels his breathing as also improved since starting antibiotics. He denies any episodes of diarrhea since admission and is without constipation or abdominal pain. He denies symptoms related to possible medication side effects such as palpitations, decreased sleep, or confusion. He is tolerating oral intake well, finishing his breakfast this morning per nursing. 
		>
		> <p class="text-primary"> He is again afebrile and remains vitally stable with BP 110/80, HR 68, and RR 16 with SpO2 96% on his baseline 2L O2. On exam, the patient appears comfortable without evidence of sputum production overnight. Heart was regular, rate and rhythm, lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without rales/rhonchi/wheezing, abdomen was soft, non-tender, and without guarding or rigidity. He again has no leg swelling bilaterally. Labs were significant today for a hemoglobin of 11.2. EKG obtained yesterday exhibited Normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 72 and a QTc of 400."
	3. Assessment and Plan
		> <p class="text-info"> "Today's plan: Number 1 AECOPD. He is on day 2 of 5 of prednisone and azithromycin with albuterol being managed by the respiratory therapist. His respiratory symptoms continue to improve and his other presenting symptoms have largely resolved. Number 2 is Hypokalemia. This has resolved with his potassium being 4.1 this morning. Number 3 is his Unspecified Anemia. Stable again today at 11.2. Overall, my disposition for this patient is for him to be discharged home with his wife this afternoon due to the resolution in his respiratory symptoms and return to his baseline O2. Prior to discharge, I plan to counsel the patient extensively on his continued smoking and provide cessation resources. He will be discharged with 3 days of prednisone and azithromycin and a prescription for albuterol for the next 30 days. I also plan to have him follow up with his PCP Dr. Straley within 7 days for his COPD, chronic anemia, and a repeat bmp to ensure his hypokalemia remains resolved. His Lovenox will be discontinued upon discharge and he will be offered both the pneumococcal and influenza vaccine."
