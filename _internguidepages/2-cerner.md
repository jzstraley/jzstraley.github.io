- Cerner is CAMC's EMR
    - Useful, but dumb at the same time
- Computers are very good at large computations and repetition
    - They are terrible at complex task or ones that have multiple variables
        - You must use this to your advantage
            - We as humans are pretty good at multivariable problems and having a device to do our repetitive tasks leave us more time to think about complicated problems
            - Don't be like computers, be smart and use dictation, dotphrases, and favorites
- This being said, Cerner is extra stupid. I've attached a few modules on how to make Cerner "smarter" and work more efficiently for YOU
