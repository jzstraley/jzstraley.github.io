- General
	- Generally, the medicine service admits from the ED
		- Check the Cap Rules to determine if there is enough room for the patient to be staffed
	- If the patient needs ICU level care, speak with your senior and see who the patient follows with as an outpatient
		- Generally, 3 options:
			- 1) WVU Pulmonology
			- 2) PAC (Pulmonary Associates of Charleston)
			- 3) No Pulmonologist doctor or Unknown (Unassigned)
                - Speak with the ICU team to determine who will be accepting the patient

- 4 main steps:
	1. PSO
	2. Admission Orders
	3. Medication Reconciliation (Admission)
	4. H&P Note
  
1. **PSO: Go see the patient after checkout from the ED and add them to the team’s list**
    - If the patient is NOT in the waiting room, and you/your senior believes they need to be admitted, place PSO (Patient Status Order)
        - This order determines patient’s hospital status (where they go) and what type of bed they need. They cannot be admitted without it.
        - If they are in the waiting room and need to be admitted, you may skip this step and move on to Step 2.
            - Eventually you will need to place a PSO once they get a bed in the ER.
        - It is very important to get this right; you cannot remove this order and changing it requires a call to Utilization Review for them to change it.
            - When in doubt, just wait for your senior resident<br><br>

    - Supervising/Attending Physician is the physician you are going to staff the patient with (who is going to be the primary)
        - Usually this is the on call team or the post-call team
	- YOU are the admitting physician, the person writing the H&P Note
	- Anticipated Length of Stay/Post Hospital Care
        - Depends on the preceved severity of the illness
        - Typically, Home or SNF (Skilled Nursing Facility)
    - Accommodation
        - SEMI = Floor (where most patients will go)
        - Intermediate/Step Down = Floor but with better Nurse-to-Patient ratios allowing closer monitoring
            - Allows drips/telemetry/Vasopressors for the most part
        - Telemetry = Pts that have an indication for telemetry (Afib w/RVR, STEMI, Etc.)
2. **Place Admission Order Set ("Adult Admission")**
    - There is a lot to this, so it is important to do this with your senior
3. **Medication Reconciliation (often not done in the ER)**
	- Go over which medications you wish to continue with the Senior Resident
		- If you are unable to complete the “Reconciliation,” complete the “Document Medication by Hx” located immediately beside the Reconciliation (See below)
		- Ideally, this should already be done in the ER, but sometimes it is not. Make sure to ask the patient their medications to complete this step
    - Place Additional Orders if needed
4. **Type Admission Note**
	- Add Problems to the problem list if not already done
        - Type: History and Physical
    - Note Template: Admission H & P Note
    - Title: “WVU IM Admission H & P Note”
        - See How to Write an Admission Note 
        - Send note to Senior 
    - Update Excel List Online
