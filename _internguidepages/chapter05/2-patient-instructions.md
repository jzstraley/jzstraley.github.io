2. Patient Instructions/Follow-Ups/Education
    - Navigate to the Inpatient Workflow Discharge Platinum and select the “Patient Instructions”<br>

	<br>
    - The instructions can be done multiple ways and as long as you communicate to the patient what needs to be done, you can do this as you like. I utilize the Uptodate method to break it down into simple easy to digest steps. I then saved it as a dotphrase .jsdischargeinstructions
        - Just make sure to save this field as it will autopopulate into your Discharge summary
        - Anywhere within the Instructions field, press Ctrl + A, then Ctrl + C<br>

	- Make sure to complete the Follow-ups and Patient education on the same page as you go
        - Follow-ups are typically with the patient’s PCP, generally I have them follow up within a few days to 10 days depending on the condition.
            - Option 1) Patient’s PCP is a random person somewhere else
                - It is not required, but encouraged to notify them about their patient needing a follow up
            - Option 2) Patient is established with Dr. Aman, Dr. Hadley, Dr. John, Dr. Durden, or Dr. Griffith
                - You will need to Select “Communicate and Message” at the top of the page to create a new message for their clinic
                - To do so:<br>

        ![Picture 6](/assets/images/internguidepages/1.5/1.5.2-picture6.png) 
        <br>
        - Send this message
            - Option 3) Patient is OPCC Resident’s patient
                - Same process as above but will select “MEM Outpatient Care Center – TCM” as the message recipient
            - NOTE: Do not schedule TCM visits if the patient is going to a SNF
        - Patient Education is to be selected based on relevance to their condition
            - Ex. Pt admitted for AECOPD could be given information on signs and symptoms of COPD exacerbation or the ALA’s information on grading their COPD exacerbation severity
