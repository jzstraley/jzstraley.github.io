- CERNER Proxy Set Up Instructions
	- In order to provide safe and appropriate patient care, as well as to be fair to your fellow residents on Charts, it is imperative that all residents maintain proxy coverage for their CERNER Message Center during vacations and/or leave. 
	- Prior to vacation approval, resident coverage must be arranged as indicated on your Internal Medicine Time Off Request Form which is signed by the covering resident and submitted beforehand.  Every resident is responsible for assigning proxy access within CERNER to whomever is providing coverage: this should be done no later than the day prior to vacation week/away rotation.  
        - Additionally, if you are the covering resident who has signed the IMTO Request Form you are responsible for remembering to cover and obtain proxy access as well.  Of note, if it is decided later you are no longer able to cover (i.e. requested vacation same week at later time), the covering resident is responsible for finding coverage for both residents.  
	- Included here is a tutorial link, only 2 minutes long, on how to assign proxy within CERNER Message Center. [Tutorial][1]
	- If you experience any difficulty assigning proxy access, please reach out to fellow residents or clinic chief prior to departing on vacation.  
	- Any deficiencies during the vacation/leave time period has potential to apply to either or both residents depending on circumstance.
