    - Prior to generating the Discharge Instructions, make sure the Home Medications, Follow-Up, and Patient Education tabs have the green check mark beside them in the Inpatient Discharge MPage. The Order Profile should still have the red star.

        - Type: Discharge Instructions
        - Note Template: Free Text Note

    - Now, at the bottom there will be my generic instructions, delete those and press Ctrl + P

    - Sign and Print this page. You will give this to the patient.
