- For Rotation specific questions:
	- [Elective Rotation Contacts 2023][1]
		- I recommend messaging the resident on the rotation prior to you to get an idea of where to go and who to contact
- Curriculum Guides
	- Available for rotations as a reference
	- Found in the [Elective Rotations folder][2] or on New Innovations 
- Rotations that may be assigned as during your ambulatory block as subspecialty clinic half-days are listed with (*). The INR. CHF, and Gyn Clinic notes are listed separately in the [Ambulatory Guides & Resources folder][3]
