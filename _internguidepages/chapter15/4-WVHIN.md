- To request access to the WVHIN,
	- Email: [info@wvhin.org][red] and [pharvit@wvhin.org][red] with the title "WVHIN Access" and ask for portal access (as below).
		- This network provides access to records from outlying hospitals in WV immediately without having to request records and wait.
		- This only apply to facilities (like RGH) that participate, this is not all inclusive but it is definitely helpful when you’re working up a new patient from scratch.
