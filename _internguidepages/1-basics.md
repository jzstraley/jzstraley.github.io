                            - Then people get mad (So just do them)

2. General (Slightly Less Important)

    - Calling/Phone
        - When in doubt, Dial “0” on any phone in the hospital
            - Links you to the operator who can direct you to the appropriate phone
            - Say who you are and where you’re calling from and where you’re trying to reach
                - Ex. “This is doctor Straley with the medicine service, could you connect me with inpatient pharmacy at memorial please”
    - [AMS Connect][8]
        - Most providers and almost all residents use [AMS connect (how to)][9]

        - Please see Onboarding to ensure your AMS is set up to receive messages.

        - If Additional coverage needed:
            - A clinic resident may be considered, and patients redistributed (M-Fr)
    - Questions?
