- General
  - Classified via the Vaughan Williams system
  - All are pro-arrhythmic
  - Ischemic or dysfunctional heart tissue is depolarized
  - All used to control arrythmias by decreasing conduction:
    - Class I and III work on Arial/Ventricular myocytes
    - Class II and IV work on the AV node
- Alcohol
  - Promostes SNS stimulation, shortens atrial effective refractory period, increased interatrial electromechanical delays, acts via vagal pathways
- Class I (Na+ Channel Blockers)
  - General
    - Inhibit phase 0 of the AP (initial depolarization)
    - Prolonged QRS at faster HR (use dependence)
      - Increase in QRS duration during stress test/exercise
      - Makes them useful
    - Use dependence (enhanced effect at faster heart rates due to tighter drug binding), seen most frequently with IC ≥ IA and rarely IB, this is why they're so good in SVTs
  - Class Ia
    - General
      - Slow conduction throughout the His-Purkinje system, atria, and ventricles and prolong the refractory state
      - Lengthens the action potential: Right shift
        - Preferentially binds sodium
        - Act on Phase 0 of the action potential
          - Prolongation of the QRS
        - No potassium blocking effects
          - No QT prolongation usually
      - SE: PVT
