- Lithium
  - Reduces suicide risk, takes 2-3 weeks to work
    - Spas have a high content of lithium
    - Works better in Euphoric Bipolar Disorder
    - 9x higher risk for suicide when coming off of
  - CI: CKD, HD, Hyponatremia, diuretics
  - Baseline: BUN, Cr, Calcium, Urinalysis, TSH, EKG if coronary risk
  - Therapeutic level: Lithium (0.6-1.2)
  - SE:
    - Hypothyroidism (add levothyroxine rather than stopping)
    - Benign Leukocytosis
    - Acute (GI)
      - Tremor, ataxia, weakness, polyuria, vomiting, diarrhea
      - AMS, Seizures, fasciculations, tremor
    - Chronic (Neuro)
      - Nephrogenic DI (MCC of), CKD, Thyroid dysfunction, Hyperparathyroidism: Polyuria in 50-70%
      - Hypercalcemia (QT shortening)
      - Treat with hemodialysis
  - Lithium Toxicity
    - ≥1.5 mEq/L: coarse tremor, tremulousness, confusion, arrhythmia, ataxia, nausea, diarrhea, nystagmus, hyperreflexia, dysarthria, dystonia
      - Fine Tremor – treat with propranolol
      - Hypothyroid – treat with levothyroxine
      - Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (hypernatremia)
        - Amiloride \< stopping
    - ≥2.5 mEq/L: Seizures, coma
      - With signs of toxicity
        - Direct nephrotoxicity – renal tubular acidosis
      - Treat with hemodialysis
    - ≥3 mEq/L: Death
    - ≥4 and creatinine ≥2: AMS, Life-threatening
      - Dialysis regardless
  - Overdose
    - Decreased renal perfusion with concurrent use of Thiazides, NSAIDS, ACEI, dehydration, tetracyclines, metronidazole
    - Volume depletion (renal failure)
- Valproic Acid (VPA)
  - Dose:
    - Valproic Acid (Depakene): Tablet, liquid (TID/BID)
      - Trough after 3 days
      - Therapeutic level: Valproate (50-200 for seizures, ≥100 = SE)
    - Divalproex Sodium (Depakote): Tablet, sprinkle, ER, IV
      - = 2 VPA + Na+

  - MOA: increases sodium channel inactivation, increases GABA concentration by inhibiting GABA transaminase

    - Adding w/alcohol, antipsychotics increase sedation
    - Increases aspirin, carbamazepine, diazepam, amitriptyline, and phenobarbital
      - Increases lamotrigine by double and increases SJS risk
    - Decreases phenytoin and desipramine
    - May augment anticoagulants
    - Fluoxetine may increase VPA
    - 10–16-hour half life
  - Use: Acute mania, TBI, migraines, epilepsy
    - Worse than lithium at depression/SI
    - Better in bipolar symptoms from cognitive disorders and migraine prophylaxis
    - Better in substance abuse, rapid cycling
  - SE: GI distress and liver problems, alopecia, neural tube defects
    - Liver Dysfunction (monitor LFTs and platelets)
      - Elevated LFTs/Hepatic failure MC during 1st 6 months
    - Sedation, teratogenesis, weight gain, hair loss, PCOS
  - CI: Pregnancy
  - Valproic Acid Toxicity
    - Somnolence, hepatotoxicity, weight and appetite changes, alopecia, insomnia, thrombocytopenia, lethargy, comatose, hypotension, tremor
- Carbamazepine (Tegretol)
  - Dose: 200mg BID to target of 1200mg total per day
  - Therapeutic level: Carbamazepine/CBZ (60-120)
  - MOA: voltage gated sodium channel blocker
    - Reduces antipsychotics, TCAs, benzos, seizure meds/mood stabilizers, warfarin, Tylenol, methadone, doxycycline, oral contraceptives
      - Reduces lamotrigine
    - Increased by fluoxetine, cimetidine, CCBs, gemfibrozil, grapefruit
    - Decreased by ETOH and phenytoin
    - Increased toxicity by VPA
  - Use: Bipolar disorder, Anticonvulsant, anticholinergic, antineuralgic, antidiuretic
    - Antiseizure, trigeminal neuralgia, bipolar
    - 2nd line mood stabilizer
      - Good for rapid cycling bipolar disorder (≥4 mood episodes/year)
  - SE: Risk of aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis, SJS, neural tube, hyponatremia, cytochrome P450 induction, diplopia, vertigo, hepatotoxic
    - Decreases T3/T4 (increased deiodination mainly), Decreases OCP efficacy, ataxia, blood dyscrasias
    - CMP and B-HCG required
    - 15% benign maculopapular rash within 3 weeks, may stop and retry
    - Neutropenia often caused by drug-induced agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia (2%)
    - CBCs monthly for 3-6m then at that interval
      - If ANC \<2000, monitor with more frequent FBCs
      - If ANC \<100, discontinue
  - Overdose: hepatotoxicity and sedation
    - 2-6 weeks after starting causative drug
      - Phenytoin or carbamazepine
    - SIADH (hyponatremia), cytochrome p450 induction
    - Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)
    - Rash, facial edema, lymphadenopathy, and fever
- Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal)
- Lamotrigine (Lamictal)
- Levetiracetam (Keppra)
- Topiramate (Topamax)
- Lacosamide (Vimpat)
- Gabapentin (Neurontin)
