- Bisphosphonates
  - Oral: Must be taken first thing in the morning and on an empty stomach with â‰¥ 8oz of plain water. Must remain upright for 30mins (alendronate, risedronate) or 60mins (ibandronate)
    - 5 year therapy, may extend to 10 if T \<-2.5 on next DEXA
  - CI: GFR \<30-35%, achalasia, Schatzki ring
  - SE: GI, hypocalcemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw
  - Alendronate (Fosamax)
    - 5mg daily or 35mg weekly PO (prevention)
    - 10mg daily or 70mg weekly PO (treatment)
    - Efficacious in preventing vertebral and non-vertebral fractures as well as hip fractures
    - Approved for treatment of osteoporosis in men, glucocorticoid-induced
  - Risedronate (Atelvia, Actonel)
    - 35mg weekly or 150mg monthly
    - Efficacious in preventing vertebral and non-vertebral fractures as well as hip fractures
    - Approved for treatment of osteoporosis in men, glucocorticoid-induced
  - Zoledronic Acid (Reclast, Zometa)
    - 5mg yearly, IV only for treatment, 5mg IV every other year for prevention
    - Approved for treatment of osteoporosis in men, glucocorticoid-induced
    - Once a year, improved survival if given within 90 days of hip fracture
    - May extend to 6 years if very high risk
    - Efficacious in preventing vertebral and non-vertebral fractures as well as hip fractures
    - SE: 30% have low-grade fever, myalgia, and arthralgia occurring 1-3 days after 1st administration, usually absent with subsequent infusions.
  - Ibandronate (Boniva)
    - 150mg once a month
    - Only efficacious in preventing vertebral fracture
    - Approved only for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis
- PTH Analogs
  - Anabolic: stimulates osteoblasts, only ones available
    - Reserved for T \<-2.5 and a fracture (severe disease)
      - Efficacious in preventing vertebral and non-vertebral fractures
    - Can only be used for 2 years due to cumulative risk of osteosarcoma, use 1 on one off
      - Must transition to either bisphosphonate or denosumab when discontinued (antiresorptive) within 1 month
      - No holiday
    - CI: CDK
    - SE: Theoretical Increased risk of bone osteosarcoma

  - Denosumab (Prolia, Xgeva)
    - MOA: Osteoclast Inhibitor
      - Monoclonal antibody inhibits RANK ligand receptors
      - Antiresorptives, No need for holiday
    - 60mg SQ Q6 months
    - Efficacious in preventing vertebral and non-vertebral fractures as well as hip fractures
    - Used if unable to take bisphosphonates
    - No defined treatment length
  - Romosozumab (Evenity)
    - Osteoblast activator
    - 20mcg subcutaneous daily
    - Anabolic
      - Associated with transient increased bone resorption (rebound) that teriparatide exacerbates (don't use)
    - Efficacious in preventing vertebral and non-vertebral fractures as well as hip fractures
    - 1 year duration of therapy only
      - Must transitioned to either bisphosphonate or denosumab when discontinued (antiresorptive) within 1 month
      - No holiday
- Calcium Regulator
  - Calcitonin (Miacalcin)
    - 200IU intranasal daily for treatment
    - Calcitonin Salmon
      - 200-unit nasal spray
      - To prevent compression fractures
      - Antiresorptive, only efficacious in preventing vertebral fracture
- Other
  - Raloxifene (Evista)
    - CI: DVT/PE, pregnant, lactating
