    - Retest in 6 weeks
  - Decreased levothyroxine absorption
    - Bile acid binding agents
    - Iron, calcium, aluminum hydroxide
    - PPIs, sucralfate
  - Increased TBG concentration
    - Oral estrogen, tamoxifen, raloxifene
    - Heroin, methadone
  - Decreased TBG concentration (increases free thyroxine)
    - Androgens, glucocorticoids, Anabolic steroids
    - Slow-release nicotinic acid (niacin)
  - Increased Thyroid hormone Metabolism
    - Rifampin, Phenytoin, Carbamazepine
  - Effects
    - Subclinical: No effects with tx
    - Clinical hypothyroid: Weight loss, decrease lipids and bp
- Antithyroid Drugs
  - Methimazole
    - Teratogenic in first trimmest of pregnancy
    - Reassess with labs at 4-6 weeks after initiation, then every 2-3 months
      - Use total T3 and free T4 early on due to TSH possibly being suppressed for several months after initiation
    - SE: Agranulocytosis, rarely hepatotoxicity
      - Presents with fever, chills, sore throat within 90 days of starting
        - Get wBC w/differential
  - Propylthiouracil (PTU)
    - Reassess with labs at 4-6 weeks after initiation, then every 2-3 months
      - Use total T3 and free T4 early on due to TSH possibly being suppressed for several months after initiation
    - SE: Agranulocytosis, hepatotoxicity more common
      - Presents with fever, chills, sore throat within 90 days of starting
        - Get wBC w/differential
  - Radioactive Iodine (RAI)
    - When the above cannot be tolerated, want to avoid surgery, and those unlikely to achieve remission ono the above alone
    - Residual hypothyroidism possible in Graves' disease
      - May exacerbate ophthalmopathy (exophthalmos, periorbital edema, vision changes)
      - Prednisone given when moderate to severe prior to surgery
      - Mild lid lag does not need prednisone
