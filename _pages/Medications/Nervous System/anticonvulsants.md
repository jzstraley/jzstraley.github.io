- Seizures
  - Partial focal, yes or no
  - Simple partial focal no
  - Complex partial focal yes
  - Gen, abs, tonic all ye and yes
  - Absence Seizures
    - Diffuse 3-Hz and wave pattern on EEG
    - Short period of profound impairment with intact body tone
  - Generalized tonic-clonic
    - Abrupt loss of consciousness, stiffening of the muscles, rhythmic jerking of extremities, open eyes during ictus
    - Most fall asleep immediately after seizure and have postictal confusion on awakening
  - Psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (PNES)
    - Conversion disorder, not true seizure
    - Forceful eye closure, side to side body movements, rapid alerting and reorienting, memory recall of seizure
    - NOT associated with abnormal cortical activity, lack post-ictal confusion
    - Intact reflexes, pelvic thrusts
    - Prolactin formal 15-30 minutes after seizure (elevated in epileptic seizure)
    - Video electroencephalogram gold standard, Psychiatric Assessment
      - Lack of epileptiform activity (normal EEG)

- Barbiturates
  - Phenobarbital
    - MOA: Increases GABAa action
    - SE: Sedation, dependence, Megaloblastic Anemia (Impaired folic acid absorption), Decreases OCP efficacy
  - Pentobarbital
  - Secobarbital
  - Primidone
    - SE: Megaloblastic Anemia (Impaired folic acid absorption)
- Carbamazepine (Tegretol)
  - MOA: Blocks Na+ channels
  - Anticonvulsant, anticholinergic, antineuralgic, antidiuretic
  - Antiseizure, trigeminal neuralgia, bipolar
  - SE: Decreases T3/T4 (increased deiodination mainly), Decreases OCP efficacy, diplopia, ataxia, blood dyscrasias, liver toxic, SIADH, SJS
- Ethosuximide (Zarontin)
  - MOA: Blocks thalamic T-type Ca2+ channels
  - USE: Absence seizures only
  - SE: Fatigue, GI distress, Headache, itching, SJS
- Gabapentinoids
  - Gabapentin (Neurontin)
    - Dose: 100mg TID up to 900mg TID
      - Renally cleared
      - Antacids decrease bioavailability by 20%
    - MOA: Increases GABA and 5HT
    - Use: Add on for seizures only
      - Off-label: sleep, bipolar, migraines, fibromyalgia, anxiety, diabetic and HIV neuropathy
    - SE: somnolence, ataxia, diplopia, dizziness
  - Pregabalin
- Lacosamide (Vimpat)
- Lamotrigine (Lamictal)
  - Dose: 12.5mg BID for 2 weeks, 25mg BID for 2 weeks, 50mg BID after
    - Dose doubled w/carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital
    - Dose every other day with VPA
    - ODT and chewable available
  - MOA: Folate antagonist, voltage gated sodium channel blocker, inhibits 5HT reuptake, inhibits release of glutamate
    - Oral contraceptives decrease Lamictal by 50%
  - Use: Depressive symptoms of bipolar depression (not acute), partial epilepsy, Lennox-Gestalt seizures, Rhett's, Alzheimer's aggression
    - 25-hour half-life
  - SE: Benign maculopapular rash(8%) within 4m ≥ SJS/TEN (0.08%)
      - Worse if \<16 or with VPA
    - Minimal sedation, minimal weight gain, mild dizziness, nausea
    - Disrupts sleep if taken after 5pm
- Levetiracetam (Keppra)
  - No close monitoring needed
  - SE: Fatigue, drowsiness, headache
    - Exacerbate depression, anxiety, irritability, non-specific psychiatric adverse effects
    - GAD and nervousness, mc in pre-existing anxiety
- Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal)
  - Dose: 300mg at night up to 600mg BID, no need for food
  - MOA: Monohydroxy metabolite, voltage gated sodium channel blocker
    - Decreased by ETOH and phenytoin
  - Use: Epilepsy, Intermittent Explosive Disorder
  - SE: sedation, nausea, dizziness, vertigo, hyponatremia (3%), decreases OCP efficacy
- Phenytoin (Dilantin)
  - SE: Megaloblastic Anemia (Impaired folic acid absorption), Decreases T3/T4 (increased deiodination mainly), Decreases OCP efficacy
  - Fosphenytoin (Cerebyx)
- Tiagabine
  - MOA: Increases GABA by inhibiting reuptake
  - Use: Only focal seizures
- Topiramate (Topamax)
  - Dose: 25mg at bedtime up to 25mg BID
  - MOA: Increases cerebral GABA
    - Increases phenytoin and VPA
    - CBZ and phenytoin decrease
    - Avoid with acetazolamide
  - Use: Epilepsy, Migraine Prophylaxis, smoking cessation, tremor, bulimia, binge eating, anxiety, weight loss
    - 24-hour half-life, Renally excreted 70%
  - SE: Decreases OCP efficacy, Mixed RTA by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase in proximal and distal tubules, paresthesia, weight loss, sedation, dizziness, word-finding difficulties (≥100mg), Cognitive suppression and sedation that does not improve with time, reduced delayed recall, slow to complete projects
    - Numbness and tingling in fingertips and peripheral extremities (may be improved by QHS dosing)
    - Lowers serum bicarb, Urine pH ≥6 and hypocitraturia, increased risk for calcium phosphate stones and cardiac arrythmias in 1.5%
- Valproic Acid (VPA)
- Vigabatrin
  - MOA: Increases GABA, irreversible GABA transaminase inhibitor
  - SE: Permanent visual loss (Black box)
- Zonisamide (Zonegran)
- Anticonvulsant Hypersensitivity Syndrome
  - Occurs after recent seizure
  - Can occur with phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, lamotrigine
  - Symptoms
    - Fever, rash, lymphadenopathy
  - Labs
    - Eosinophilia
    - Elevated Transaminases
