- Antacids
  - General:
    - Work for 1-2 hours
  - Magnesium (Increases Motility)
  - Aluminum (Decreases Motility)
  - Calcium Carbonate/Silicate
  - Sodium Bicarbonate
- H2 Receptor Antagonists (H2RAs)
  - MOA: Inhibit binding of histamine, released from enterochromaffin-like cells, at the H2 receptor on parietal cells and thus decreasing the hydrogen ion concentration in the stomach
  - General:
    - Work for 6-10 hours, greater efficacy and can be used for prophylaxis vs antacids
  - Famotidine (Pepcid)
    - Least likely too interfere with P450 enzymes
  - Ranitidine (Zantac)
  - Cimetidine (Tagamet)
    - Inhibits P450 enzymes
- Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)
  - MOA: Decreases hydrogen ion concentration in the stomach by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPases on parietal cells
    - Only inhibit active proton pumps, leads to weak acid inhibition
    - Need 5-7 days for drug steady state
    - Work faster and are more effective than H2Ras
    - SE: Osteoporosis
      - Nephrotoxic in CKD
  - Esomeprazole (Nexium)
  - Lansoprazole (Prevacid)
  - Omeprazole (Prilosec)
  - Pantoprazole (Protonix)
  - SE: Sporadic fundic gland polyps
- Prostaglandins
  - Misoprostol
  - Enprostil
- Other
  - Bismuth Subcitrate
  - Sucralfate
