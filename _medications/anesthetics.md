    - 50mg up to 300mg ER
    - MOA: mu-opioid receptor agonist, inhibits 5-HT and NE reuptake
      - Metabolized by CYP2D6/CYP3A4 (Unlike hydromorphone/morphine)
    - Variable time to onset and efficacy in liver failure
    - SE: Serotonin Syndrome, Seizures
- Sedative-Hypnotics
  - CNS depression
    - Sedation
    - Hypnosis
    - Anesthesia
    - Coma
  - Benzodiazepines
    - Anxiolysis, hypnosis, amnesia, no analgesic properties
    - Midazolam commonly used
    - Metabolized by the liver
    - Flumazenil to treat OD
  - Barbiturates
    - Phenobarbital
      - Can be used in Crigler-Najjar II to induce UDP-glucuronyl transferase
  - Ketamine
    - PCP analog
    - Intense analgesia, amnesia, dissociative anesthesia
    - Increases HR and BP, maintains spontaneous ventilation
      - Excellent bronchodilator
    - Pre-medicate with benzodiazepines to limit illusions and dysphoria
    - Not respiratory depressant
  - Thiopental (Pentothal)
    - Barbiturate, unconsciousness in 30s
    - No analgesic effects
    - Decreases cerebral O2 demand, excellent anticonvulsant
    - Requires repeated dosing
    - Hypotension, HF, Beta-blockade
  - Morphine
    - 5mg IV
  - Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)
    - 75mg IV
  - Fentanyl
    - 50mcg IV (50-150mcg/hr)
  - Propofol (Diprivan)
    - CYP2B6 Substrate
    - Antipyretic and antiemetic properties
      - Mild analgesic effect
      - Metabolized by the liver and plasma esterase
    - SE: Severe hypotension due to myocardial depression (inhibits sympathetic drive)
      - Avoid in patients with ventricular systolic dysfunction
      - Prolonged sedation even after discontinuation
  - Dexmedetomidine (Precedex)
    - Alpha-2 Agonism
  - Etomidate (Amidate)
    - Inhibition of 11B-hydroxylase
    - Adrenal insufficiency in elderly and critically ill
    - May cause respiratory arrest
    - No analgesic effects
    - No change in BP
    - Metabolized by the liver and plasma esterase
  - Halothane (Fluothane)
    - Acute Hepatic toxicity in Adult women
  - Nitrous Oxide (N2O)
    - Inhibition of methionine synthase, inactivates B12
    - Neurotoxicity in pts with B12 deficiency
    - SE: mild ICP, CBF, CMRO2, PONV, decreased hepatic/renal blood flow
- Long time to induction
  - Opioid Abuse
- Long time coming out anesthesia
  - Absence of pseudocholinesterase
  - Lambert-Eaton Myasthenia
    - Increased sensitivity to both depolarizing muscle relaxants (succinylcholine): takes more time to reaccumulate acetylcholine
